# hiring_process_analytics

This project is about Hiring Process Analytics. I am working 
for a MNC such as Google as a lead Data Analyst. I was asked to answer certain 
questions and make sense out of the data records of companyâ€™s previous 
hirings. It was required to use my knowledge in statistics and use different 
formulas in excel and draw necessary conclusions about the company
First it was required to download the dataset, then use Excel or Google Sheets 
to answer the below questions:

1. Hiring: 
How many males and females are Hired ?

2. Average Salary:
What is the average salary offered in this company ?

3. Class Intervals: 
Draw the class intervals for salary in the company ?

4. Charts and Plots: 
Draw Pie Chart / Bar Graph ( or any other graph ) to show proportion of 
people working different department ?

5. Charts:
Represent different post tiers using chart/graph?
